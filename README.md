#  🚀 Deep Dive into E-commerce Data Analysis Using Machine Learning


## 🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning
Cleaning the dataset was the foundation of this project. I focused on:

Missing Data: Identified gaps in the data and handled them using appropriate imputation methods.
Outliers: Detected anomalies using statistical techniques and visualizations, ensuring they didn’t distort the analysis.
## 📊 Step 2: Data Visualization
To understand the data better, I created visualizations using various tools, such as:

Boxplot: To observe data distribution and detect outliers.
KDEplot: For understanding probability densities.
Pairplot: To explore relationships between multiple features.
Histplot: For distribution of individual variables.
Barplot: To highlight categorical trends.
These visualizations revealed patterns in customer behavior and product performance, providing a solid base for deeper analysis.

## 🤖 Step 3: Machine Learning
I applied several models to explore predictions and clustering:

Linear Regression: To predict key metrics and trends.
Ridge Regression: To handle multicollinearity and improve predictive accuracy.
K-Means Clustering: To segment data into meaningful clusters, identifying distinct customer groups.
